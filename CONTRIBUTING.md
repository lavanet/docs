# Welcome to Lava docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

> First of all - THANK YOU for taking the time to contribute! üåãüëç

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), all your changes will be reflected on Lava Docs @ [docs.lavanet.xyz](https://docs.lavanet.xyz)

### How can you help üí™?
1. Report an issue/mistake you found
2. Suggest a fix via PR (read below)
3. Want to add new content/tutorials? Please propose it first via a new issue, and only then write it up, to save you time

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of Lava, read the [Docs Intro](/docs/intro.md). 

This repository aligns with best practices for contributing to open source as you will find in many repositories on GitHub. If you are not familiar with these, please start with these great resources:
- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Styleguide
Lava docs serves multiple user types in different lifecycle steps.
We want to create a doc resource that will fit all, but have a common denominator of style.

Styleguides are guidance and not a restriction, good articles we picked for this purpose are:
- When it comes to git opeartions, we recommend https://cbea.ms/git-commit/
- When it is docs actual content, we recommend https://medium.com/larimaza-en/how-to-write-good-documentation-e19c70dc67f0

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/lavanet/docs/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/lavanet/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes to content

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review. 

#### Make changes locally

1. Install Git
2. Fork the repository
3. Clone it to your working space 
4. Run a local version using  `$ yarn start`
5. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit & Pull Request

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. 

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
