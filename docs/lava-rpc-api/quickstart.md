# Quickstart: Accessing Lava RPC API

Lava RPC API gives developers fast, reliable access to blockchain data - without the overhead of running their own node. With Lava Network, you can power any use case that requires ultra-reliable blockchain connectivity.

This guide walks you through creating an account, selecting an endpoint, and making your first RPC call.

## Step 1: Create a Lava RPC API account

1. Go to https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/.
2. Sign up for a free account to access RPC endpoints.

## Step 2: Choose your chain

Once logged in, you’ll see a dashboard of supported blockchains.

Select the chain you’re building on to view available RPC endpoint options.

## Step 3: Select the network

Each chain provides mainnet and testnet endpoints.
Use the toggle in the UI to choose the network appropriate for your project.

## Step 4: Pick an API interface

By default, Lava provides HTTP RPC endpoints.
Some chains - like Ethereum - also support additional interfaces such as WebSocket (WS).

Click the API method dropdown to view and select from all supported interfaces.

## Step 5: Get your endpoint

A dedicated endpoint will be created for you along with a code snippet.

You can:
- Run the snippet directly in the Lava RPC API UI, or
- Copy the endpoint into your application, script, or wallet configuration.

## Step 6: Start building

Copy your endpoint, put it in your code or wallet configuration and start building with Lava RPC API.
