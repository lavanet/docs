Lava RPC API delivers permissionless, decentralized blockchain RPC data access purpose-built for dapps, wallets, AI agents, and any application that needs fast, reliable chain data.

## Why Lava RPC API

Lava Network's decentralized RPC Routing Engine abstracts away infra complexity so you can focus on building, while ensuring:

- Maximum uptime 
- Optimized latency & performance 
- Data freshness & integrity

The API exposes the standard low-level RPC interface for your chain of choice. Get started quickly on a free tier, then scale with paid plans for higher throughput and advanced controls.

## What you get (Freemium)

- Free access to 28+ supported chains  
- Dedicated endpoints that allow you to scale your RPC access as your application grows
- 25–100 RPS, depending on usage  
- No lock-in, no infra to manage - perfect for early development

Ready to scale? See [Access Plans](rpc-access-plans.md) for higher throughput, predictable performance, SLAs, and priority support.
