# Supported Chains on Lava Network

The Lava RPC API supports a broad and growing list of leading blockchains. Each chain is backed by a globally distributed node infrastructure that ensures high reliability, low latency, and consistent performance across both mainnet and testnet environments.

This page provides an overview of the supported chains, available add-ons, and geolocation coverage.

## Chain Coverage
Lava Network currently provides RPC access to 28+ major networks, including:

- Ethereum & EVM-compatible chains (Hyperliquid, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.)
- Cosmos ecosystem chains
- Solana
- Near
- Other high-demand L1 and L2 networks

See the full chain list in the [Lava RPC API UI](https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/).

## Networks
For each supported chain, Lava Network provides endpoints for:

- **Mainnet** - for production-ready applications.
- **Testnet(s)** - for development, testing, and staging environments.

You can switch between environments directly in the Lava RPC API UI or via the API endpoint selector.

## Add-Ons

In addition to standard RPC functionality, certain chains support extended APIs:

- **Archive Data** - Access to the full historical state of the blockchain.
- **Trace** - Low-level transaction tracing for debugging and analysis.
- **Debug** - Developer-focused methods for transaction simulation, replay, and state inspection.

Add-ons are enabled per-chain and per-plan. Check the [Lava RPC API UI](https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/) to see which add-ons are available for your selected endpoint.

## Geolocation Coverage

Lava Networkâ€™s RPC nodes are globally distributed across multiple regions to minimize latency and ensure failover redundancy.

- Europe
- US-Center
- US-East
- US-West
- Asia
- Africa
- Australia

Developers are automatically routed to their nearest geographical region for optimal performance. Enterprise plans can configure region pinning for strict latency or compliance requirements.
