# Power-up Lava as a Validator

This section will help you start as a validator, step by step.
For additional help see the [FAQ Section](faq.md)

## What is a Validator?
Lava blockchain uses Proof-of-stake (PoS) as the consensus mechanism, based on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/). Validators participate in the network by verifying new blocks to earn rewards.

LAVA holders are incentivized to stake their tokens to secure Lava while receiving a reward in return.
Validators earn LAVA from the creation of new blocks and the transaction fees, and on the other hand - slashing may occur to punish bad actors, all facilitated by Tendermint's consensus protocol. 

_Note_: This does not cover Delegating LAVA to validators


:::tip Start a validator - Auto _or_ Manual?
The sections below outlay both ways to start your validator, choose:

[<RoadmapItem icon="🤖" title="Automatic scripts" description="If you want to get started first, and later on dive into specific subjects, that will work as well. The scripts are available as source code as well"/>](#auto)

[<RoadmapItem icon="🛠" title="Manual steps" description="If you are already familiar with running validators, or love to orchestrate your own setup, this is the path for you"/>](#manual)
:::

## Start - 🤖 Automatic scripts {#auto}

### 1. Install node (`lavad`) & Join network

**Prepare**
```bash
sudo apt update
``` 

```bash
sudo apt install curl unzip coreutils -y
```

**Install and join the network**

Running the script will:

1. Install `lavad`
2. Join the testnet
3. Sync to latest block

```bash
curl -s --location --request GET 'https://get.lavanet.xyz/pnet_join_network' --header 'Authorization: Basic OHRmem1Ta2VuSE1CajhwcDpSRXBhYWZmS2I3TTNQNlBt' > 00_join_network.sh && \
    chmod +x 00_join_network.sh && \
    ./00_join_network.sh production
```

### 2. Prepare an account & Fund it
If you don't have an account already, you can use this script to create one for you:

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://get.lavanet.xyz/pnet_run_node' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic OHRmem1Ta2VuSE1CajhwcDpSRXBhYWZmS2I3TTNQNlBt' > 01_run_node.sh && \
chmod +x 01_run_node.sh && \
./01_run_node.sh production create_account
```

Script finished? Write down the details you'll need later:

:::caution Pencils out 📝
Keep the newly created account info:
1. SECRET mnemonic phrase 🚨🤫🚨🤫🚨
2. Your public address, starts with `lava@`
3. Your validator pubkey

♻ Save those details as we make sure to automatically airdrop you with LAVA test tokens as soon as we restart the testnet.

### 3. Stake & start validating

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://get.lavanet.xyz/pnet_run_node' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic OHRmem1Ta2VuSE1CajhwcDpSRXBhYWZmS2I3TTNQNlBt' > 01_run_node.sh && \
chmod +x 01_run_node.sh && \
./01_run_node.sh production stake_validator
```


## Start - 🛠 Manual steps {#manual}

### 1. Install node (`lavad`) & Join network {#lavad}
Running as a validator requires a Lava Node running, Please refer to [our guide for joining **Testnet**](testnet) for details.

### 2. Prepare an account & Fund it {#account}
Lava account and wallets are standard Cosmos. Learn more in [Account & Wallet section](wallet).

Now that you decided you want to turn your node into a validator, you will first need to add a wallet to your keyring ([FAQ: what is a keyring](faq#keyring)).

While you can add an existing wallet through your seed phrase, we will create a new wallet in this example (replace $KEY_NAME with a name of your choosing):

```bash
lavad keys add $KEY_NAME
```

:::danger
Ensure you write down the mnemonic as you can not recover the wallet without it. 
:::

To ensure your wallet was saved to your keyring, look for the WALLET_NAME is in your keys list:

```bash
lavad keys list
```

The last thing needed before initializing the validator is to obtain your **validator public** key which was created when you first initialized your node. To obtain your validator pubkey:

```bash
lavad tendermint show-validator
```

:::caution Pencils out 📝
Keep the newly created account info:
1. SECRET mnemonic phrase 🚨🤫🚨🤫🚨
2. Your public address, starts with `lava@`
3. Your validator pubkey

♻ Save those details as we make sure to automatically airdrop you with LAVA test tokens as soon as we restart the testnet.

Now you can receive test LAVA tokens using our [faucets](./lava-blockchain/faucet.mdx).

### 3. Stake & start validating {#stake}

Once your account is funded, run this to stake and start validating.

Note to set `$STAKE_AMOUNT` (currently `50000000ulava`) and `$KEY_NAME`:
```bash
lavad tx staking create-validator \
    --amount="$STAKE_AMOUNT" \
    --pubkey=$(lavad tendermint show-validator --home "$HOME/.lava/") \
    --chain-id=lava \
    --commission-rate="0.10" \
    --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
    --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
    --min-self-delegation="10000" \
    --gas="auto" \
    --gas-adjustment "1.5" \
    --gas-prices="0.0025ulava" \
    --home="$HOME/.lava/" \
    --from=$KEY_NAME
```
