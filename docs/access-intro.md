# Web3 APIs ⚡️

Lava offers several attractive entry ways to our peer-to-peer RPC network. Unfortunately, it can be confusing to new developers on which one to select! 



Lava offers:

- **[a Hosted Gateway (web UI)](https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/login?utm_source=access-intro-page&utm_medium=docs)**
- **[an SDK (TypeScript library)](https://github.com/lavanet/lava-sdk)**
- **[a Server Kit (binary)](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/tree/main/protocol/rpcconsumer)**

No matter which offering you choose, you still get the same high speed, accountable RPC providers served from our P2P network.
