# Decentralized and Permissionless RPC for Any Blockchain

Every blockchain interaction - from making a trade, to debugging a smart contract, to checking your account balance - relies on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). RPC is the universal language of blockchain, enabling users to read and write data in real-time across networks. Yet the way we access blockchain data today remains fragmented and unreliable:
- **No single provider covers all chains**, making multi-chain application development complex and resource-intensive.
- **Developers face a trade-off:** run their own nodes (costly and operationally complex) or rely on centralized RPC providers (introducing single points of failure, downtime risk, and privacy concerns).
- **New chains struggle to bootstrap infrastructure**, often depending on a small set of community node providers with limited incentives or guarantees for high operational standards.

Lava Network is building out a new industry standard for blockchain data access. By coordinating an ecosystem of independent RPC Node Providers, Lava Network delivers permissionless and decentralized RPC API that delivers high-performance services. Each request is routed to the fastest and most reliable nodes - ensuring censorship-resistant, secure, and scalable access to blockchain data.



## For Developers of Blockchain Applications: Lava RPC API

Lava RPC API delivers access to permissionless, decentralized blockchain RPC data access, designed for dapps, wallets, AI agents, and any application requiring blockchain data.

Powered by Lava Network’s RPC Routing Engine, the API abstracts away infrastructure complexity while ensuring:

- Maximum uptime
- Optimized latency and performance
- Data freshness and integrity

The API exposes the standard low-level RPC interface for accessing the data for the blockchain of your choice. Developers can get started quickly with a free tier, while paid plans provide higher rate limits and advanced controls for scaling.

## For Blockchains & Rollups: Lava Public RPC

Every blockchain and rollup requires reliable, permissionless RPC to onboard developers and scale its ecosystem. Lava Public RPC enables projects to quickly launch decentralized RPC infrastructure through an automated on-chain RPC budget management solution. 

Powered by the RPC Routing Engine, Lava Public RPC allows chains to leverage the Lava Network’s community of RPC Node Providers to launch a public RPC endpoint for developers.


Integrating with Lava Network involves:
- **Spec definition** – define supported APIs and RPC methods in a simple JSON specification. This step is typically completed by Lava Ecosystem contributors.

- **Funding Lava Public RPC** – the LAVA Tokens are utilized to compensate RPC Node Providers that serve requests for your chain.

- **Scaling your ecosystem with public RPC endpoints** – share open RPC endpoints with your developer community to enable frictionless onboarding from day one.

Learn how you can bootstrap your ecosystem with [Lava Public RPC](../lava-public-rpc/lava-public-rpc-overview.md).


## For Enterprises & Infrastructure Teams: Enterprise RPC Smart Router

Enterprises often rely on multiple RPC providers (e.g., Alchemy, Infura) to support mission-critical blockchain applications. The RPC Smart Router is an enterprise-grade blockchain RPC orchestration solution, powered by the Lava RPC Routing Engine, and built to unify and optimize these complex setups while ensuring maximum reliability and performance. 

The RPC Smart Router enables:
- **Unified control plane** for managing nodes across multiple RPC providers and chains
- **Optimal request routing** to the fastest and healthiest RPC providers, ensuring low latency and consistent performance
- **Built-in failover and caching** to guarantee maximum uptime and minimize downtime risk
- **Cross-validated security** to protect applications from inaccurate or malicious data
- **Full observability and real-time metrics** for monitoring, auditing, and performance tuning

The RPC Smart Router is ideal for organizations that demand high availability, multi-chain support, and vendor flexibility - without sacrificing performance or security.

## Permissionless Decentralized RPC & API access to 30+ chains

Lava Network currently provides RPC access to **30+ blockchains and rollups** (mainnets and testnets), all powered by a community of RPC Node Providers who permissionlessly join the Lava Network to service the data requests.

Beyond standard RPC, Lava RPC Node Providers also support **archival requests** and advanced **add-ons** like `debug` and `trace`. Lava RPC Node Providers are globally distributed across **Europe, Asia, and various regions of the US**, minimizing latency and ensuring high uptime for developers everywhere.
