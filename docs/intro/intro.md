## Overview 🔍

Web3 is only as strong as its weakest link. Today, due to complexities and lack of incentives to run your own node, apps rely on costly centralized services, unreliable public RPC endpoints, and self-hosted services. Lava is here to fix it. Access Lava, Access Web3.

Lava is built as an application-specific L1 PoS Blockchain, based on [CosmosSDK](https://tendermint.com/sdk/). We are building the most reliable, modular, and extensible network, which ensures high network performance and secure blockchain access for all web3 APIs. 

Lava documentation is intended to be the definitive reference for all technical aspects of Lava Protocol. For other information about Lava Network, please visit our [blog](https://www.lavanet.xyz/blog?utm_source=intro-page&utm_medium=docs) or review our new [research](https://community.lavanet.xyz/c/research/9?utm_source=intro-page&utm_medium=docs)!
