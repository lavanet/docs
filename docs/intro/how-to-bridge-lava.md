# How to Bridge Lava on Arbitrum Tokens to Lava Mainnet Tokens 

## Introduction to Lava

Lava is a Cosmos-based protocol that coordinates traffic for the onchain world. When you use a blockchain app, you send a stream of traffic - transactions, data queries - to the underlying chain. Lava aggregates data providers to serve AI agent and dapp traffic, dynamically routing requests to the fastest, most reliable providers.

Because LAVA exists both as an ERC20 token on **Arbitrum (an Ethereum Layer 2)** and as a native token on Lava Mainnet, some holders may have LAVA on Arbitrum, while others have Lava Mainnet tokens. To participate in staking or restaking on the Lava Network‚Äîand earn rewards from incentive pools‚Äîyou need **Lava Mainnet tokens**. Bridging is therefore essential for anyone with Lava on Arbitrum.

### Why Are There Two Lava Tokens?

1. **LAVA on Arbitrum (ERC20 token):**
    - Traded on centralized and decentralized exchanges (e.g., Bybit, Uniswap)
    - Runs on Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer 2
    - Compatible with EVM dapps, DeFi protocols, and other use-cases
2. **Lava Mainnet Token [native LAVA]:**
    - Powers the Lava Network protocol
    - Used for staking, restaking, and securing the network
    - Required to earn incentives from Lava‚Äôs unique contributor rewards model

**_Note:_** 
LAVA is available on DEXs: Osmosis (Lava Mainnet), Uniswap (ERC-20 Arbitrum, ERC-20 Base) and Pancakeswap (ERC-20 BSC).
- LAVA contract address on Arbitrum: `0x11e969e9B3f89cB16D686a03Cd8508C9fC0361AF`
- LAVA address on Binance Smart Chain: `0xFfeB8287dE7DC756067e171e9919c730f0636680`
- LAVA contract address on Base: `0x11e969e9B3f89cB16D686a03Cd8508C9fC0361AF`
- LAVA on Base and BSC **is not transferable to CEXs** as they only support the Arbitrum or Lava Mainnet version of LAVA.

If you purchased LAVA tokens on **KuCoin**, you already have Lava Mainnet tokens and do **not** need to bridge. These tokens can be staked or restaked immediately by transferring them to a Cosmos-compatible wallet, such as **Leap** or **Keplr**.

### How Lava Works at a Glance

- **Validators** secure the Lava blockchain and validate blocks.
- **Providers** register on Lava blockchain to offer high-quality RPC services.
- **Stakers** delegate Lava Mainnet tokens to Validators to secure the Lava blockchain.
- **Restakers** delegate Lava Mainnet tokens to top Providers to route traffic to them.

When blockchains use Lava to coordinate their RPC, they create incentive pools in their native tokens. Contributors‚ÄîValidators, Stakers, Providers, and Restakers‚Äîcan earn rewards from these pools.

### Why Bridge Your Lava from Arbitrum to Mainnet?

- **Support and Secure the Lava Network:** Lava Mainnet tokens let you fully participate in the ecosystem‚Äîhelping to secure the network, direct RPC traffic, and contribute to the protocol‚Äôs long-term success.
- **Earn Staking & Restaking Rewards:** Lava Mainnet token holders who stake and restake their tokens are eligible for rewards. Staking of Lava Mainnet Tokens is also required as part of the Validator and Provider eligibility process.

Below is a guided process using two popular bridging routes: **Skip:Go and Squid Router**. You‚Äôll need an **Ethereum-compatible wallet** (such as MetaMask), and a **Cosmos-compatible wallet** (Leap or Keplr) for Lava Mainnet.

- Skip:Go: https://go.skip.build/
- Squid Router: https://app.squidrouter.com/
- MetaMask: https://metamask.io/
- Leap: https://app.leapwallet.io/
- Keplr: https://wallet.keplr.app/

<br/>

# 1. Prepare Your Wallets

## 1.1 Lava on Arbitrum
Transfer your ERC20 LAVA tokens from the CEX to your Arbitrum wallet e.g., MetaMask.

**_Note:_** If your tokens are on Kucoin, you should only transfer to a Cosmos wallet because they are already native LAVA tokens.

## 1.2 Add Arbitrum Network in MetaMask
1. Open MetaMask and click the network selector (usually labeled "Ethereum Mainnet").

2. Click "Add Network", then add/approve Arbitrum if it's not already in your list.

![MetaMask settings for adding or switching to the Arbitrum network pt2](/img/tutorial/how_to_bridge/MetaMask_Arbitrum.png)

3. You can verify the Arbitrum network details at (arbitrum-mainnet.infura.io).

## 1.3 Import the Lava (Arbitrum) Token Contract
1. Copy the official Lava on Arbitrum **ERC20 contract address** from a reliable source:
- **Arbiscan:** https://arbiscan.io/token/0x11e969e9B3f89cB16D686a03Cd8508C9fC0361AF
- **Copy & Paste:** `0x11e969e9B3f89cB16D686a03Cd8508C9fC0361AF`
- **Lava Website:** https://www.lavanet.xyz/blog/eruption 

2. In MetaMask, click **Import Tokens**, paste the contract address, and confirm.

<br/>

## Next Step: Staking and Restaking

Now that you‚Äôve bridged your Lava tokens from Arbitrum to Lava Mainnet, you can:

- **Stake** to **Validators** to secure the network and validate blocks.
- **Restake** to direct traffic to **Providers** who deliver high-quality RPC services for supported chains. 

Both Stakers and Restakers earn additional incentives from the protocol.

<br/>

By bridging your Lava on Arbitrum tokens to Lava Mainnet, you unlock the full utility of the Lava Network‚Äîsecuring the ecosystem, directing RPC traffic, and earning rewards alongside other contributors.
