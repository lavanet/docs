# How to stake and restake LAVA 

Lava's vision is to enable AI agents and anyone to use blockchain apps, 24/7, with no downtime.

Lava is a protocol which coordinates dapp and AI agent traffic on every blockchain. Lava aggregates RPC providers, dynamically scaling to support demand and routing requests to the fastest, most reliable providers.

The following instructions will walk you through how LAVA (Lava Mainnet tokens) can be staked and restaked. If your tokens were acquired on Bybit, Gate or MEXC, they are ERC-20 LAVA and you first need to bridge to Lava Mainnet. See [How to Bridge Lava](how-to-bridge-lava).

**Step 5:** Select a Provider of your choice. Notice the amount of services a Provider offers. More services likely means a Provider is supporting more chains and may be earning tokens from multiple chains at once. LAVA restakers will receive tokens from those chains too.
