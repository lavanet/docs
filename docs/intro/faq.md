# FAQs

## 1. How is Lava Network different from centralized RPC providers?

Centralized RPC providers rely on a small number data of centers, creating single points of failure and opaque service quality. Lava Network solves this by offering **a decentralized, permissionless RPC network** where multiple providers compete to serve requests. Provider performance is enforced on-chain through reputation and incentives, ensuring reliable, censorship-resistant, and scalable access to blockchain data across ecosystems.


## 2. Who can benefit the most from Lava RPC API?

Any application that needs reliable access to blockchain data can benefit from Lava RPC API. This includes:


Wallets that require dependable user transaction queries.
DeFi protocols that depend on accurate and timely blockchain state.
Analytics platforms and explorers that need to query multiple chains at scale.
Web3 games and AI agents that require seamless, cost-efficient RPC connectivity.

## 3. Which blockchains does Lava Network support?

Lava Network currently supports over 30 blockchains, including both EVM-compatible and non-EVM networks, across mainnets and testnets. Popular supported chains include Ethereum, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Near, and many more. You can find the up-to-date list of supported chains on the Lava Info Page.


## 4. How can I add my chain to Lava Network?

Foundations and ecosystem teams can bootstrap decentralized Public RPC infrastructure for their chain by sponsoring pools on Lava Network. This ensures reliable and censorship-resistant data access while supporting a network of Lava RPC node providers. To add your chain to Lava, please contact the Lava team.


## 5. Can I use Lava RPC API for free?

Yes. Developers can start building with Lava PRC API at no cost. Lava offers a freemium plan for accessing the Lava RPC API, as well as free Lava Public RPC endpoints provided by some supported chains. These options are ideal for testing, learning, and smaller-scale applications.

Teams with higher traffic needs can easily upgrade to paid plans for additional reliability and performance.


## 6. Do I need to register to become a Lava RPC Node Provider?

No registration is required. Lava Network is permissionless - anyone can join as a Lava RPC Node Provider. To do so, you must operate infrastructure for your chosen chains, stake LAVA tokens, and configure your provider to serve requests through the Lava Network.


## 7. Where can I learn more about the Lava protocol?

This documentation site contains comprehensive technical information about Lava Networkâ€™s protocol, architecture, and implementation. For deeper insights into the protocol design and vision, refer to the Lava whitepaper.


## 8. How can I monitor the status of the Lava Network?

You can track real-time metrics and network performance at stats.lavanet.xyz.
