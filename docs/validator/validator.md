# Power-up Lava as a Validator

This section will help you start as a validator, step by step.
For additional help see the [FAQ Section](/faq)

## What is a Validator?
Lava blockchain uses Proof-of-stake (PoS) as the consensus mechanism, based on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/). Validators participate in the network by verifying new blocks to earn rewards.

LAVA holders are incentivized to stake their tokens to secure Lava while receiving a reward in return.
Validators earn LAVA from the creation of new blocks and the transaction fees, and on the other hand - slashing may occur to punish bad actors, all facilitated by Tendermint's consensus protocol. 

_Note_: This does not cover Delegating LAVA to validators
