# Validator Rewards

Validators in the Lava Protocol earn rewards through multiple mechanisms, including block rewards, delegation commissions, and incentives from RPC pools. These rewards are distributed based on network participation and validator performance.

## Reward Mechanism

### Block Rewards
- Validators and their delegators/restakers earn rewards for each successfully signed block.
- Rewards are sourced from a reserve fund, allocated at **3.4%** of the total LAVA supply.

### Delegation Commission
- Validators can set a commission rate on rewards earned by their delegators.
- This commission is deducted before distributing rewards to delegators.

### Provider Subscription Rewards
- **4.9%** of total subscription revenue is allocated to validators and their delegators.
- These rewards are derived from user subscriptions to data services within the Lava ecosystem.

### Incentivized RPC Pool Rewards
- **4.9%** of RPC pool rewards are distributed to validators and their delegators.
- RPC Pools consist of native tokens from blockchains deployed on the Lava Network, providing additional incentives.

## Get Insight into Monthly Validator Rewards

You can find a detailed breakdown of validator rewards by visiting the **[Lava Rewards page](https://rewards.lavanet.xyz/validator_rewards).**  

### Breakdown of Rewards

- **Self-Bond Rewards** – Rewards earned from the validator's personally staked LAVA tokens. These rewards are proportional to their self-bonded stake, incentivizing validators to maintain network security. Distributed automatically with each block.

- **Commission Rewards** – Commission fees collected from delegator rewards based on the validator's set commission rate. These are earned whenever delegators receive their staking rewards.

- **Estimated Rewards** – Projected monthly rewards based on current LAVA network activity, including IPRPC services, block rewards, and subscriptions. These rewards are distributed through a monthly blockchain event, typically occurring between the **17th and 18th** of each month.

- **Outstanding Rewards** – Unclaimed validator rewards that have been allocated but not yet withdrawn. These are available for the validator to claim at any time.
