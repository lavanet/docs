# Validator Delegation Program  

The **Lava Foundation** runs a **validator delegation program** aimed at incentivizing high-quality service from validators.  

## Delegation Rounds  

Delegation rounds occur every **six months** and are open to all existing and new Lava validators. These rounds are usually announced on the **Lava blog** and **include** a form that validators must fill out to be considered for delegation.  

## Delegation Criteria  

Each delegation round includes a specific set of criteria that validators must meet to receive delegation. For example:  

- **Quality of Service (QoS):** The reliability and performance of the validator.  
- **Technical Setup:** The robustness and security of the validator’s infrastructure.  
- **Validator Contribution:** Active involvement and contributions to the network.  
- **Marketing Impact:** The validator’s ability and experience in promoting and positively impacting the ecosystem.  

## Additional Information  

The **number of eligible validators** and the **delegation amounts** are determined for each validation round and are subject to change. The goal is to **secure the network, increase efficiency, and allow market dynamics to flourish.**  

## Dynamic Delegation Adjustments

Validators are evaluated each quarter:

- Validators failing to meet the established benchmarks may be cycled out in favor of new entrants.
- This regular assessment ensures that Lava's validator community remains vibrant, effective, and aligned with the evolving demands of the network.


## Special Considerations for Commercial Partners

Some commercial partners, such as web infrastructure or analytical service providers, are engaged differently. These partners may not fit into the standard tier system as their delegations are tailored to the specific services and value they provide to the network.

## Conclusion

Lava aims to foster a transparent, fair, and competitive environment for all validators, ensuring the long-term security and efficiency of the network. Regular updates and adjustments to the delegation policy will be communicated to all stakeholders to maintain transparency and engagement across the Lava ecosystem.
