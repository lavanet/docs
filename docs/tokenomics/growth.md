# 🪙 Growth
Lava has a capped token supply which is managed by DAO governance. There are existing and future plans to stimulate ecosystem growth: 

## 🌋 Magma Points 
Points are separate to LAVA tokens and can be used to reward loyal community members. Lava Foundation can distribute points to chains using Lava’s Incentivized RPC Pools; points distribution can be decided by the chain. Additionally, wallet-users can earn points by using Lava-powered RPC to access partner chains. 

## 🌊 Incentivized RPC Pools

Chains create Incentivized RPC Pools on Lava by depositing their native token. This pool is used to incentivize Providers to serve and scale the chain’s RPC infrastructure. As more rollups deploy with Lava, more pools will be created for Providers to earn the tokens of those rollups as rewards. Delegators and restakers may also earn rewards as part of these pools.

## 🎉 Lava Drop Seasons
To boost growth and engagement, airdrops to network participants may take place. 

## 💧 Provider Drops
**6.6%** of LAVA total supply has been allocated to bootstrap initial growth of the network and attract providers.
LAVA tokens will be automatically distributed monthly to providers on-chain, and the amount of tokens will be variable depending on paid demand for data through Lava.

## 🌐 Community Pool
Lava has a community pool which accrues funds from block rewards, subscriptions and Incentivized RPC Pools. Funds can be used by the DAO to conduct future initiatives engaging the community. 
- **2%** of block rewards 
- **0.1%** of Subscription rewards
- **0.1%** of Incentivized RPC Pool rewards
