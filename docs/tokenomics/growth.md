# 🪙 Tokenomics: Growth with Magma
Lava has a deflationary token supply which is managed by DAO governance. There are existing and future plans to stimulate ecosystem growth: 

## 🌋 Magma Points 
Points are separate to LAVA tokens and can be used to reward loyal community members. Lava Foundation will distribute points to chains using Lava’s Incentivized RPC Pools; points distribution will be decided by the chain. Additionally, wallet-users can earn points by using Lava-powered RPC to access partner chains. 

## 🎉 Lava Drop Seasons
To boost growth and engagement, airdrops to network participants may take place. 

## 💧 Provider Drops
**6.6%** of LAVA total supply has been allocated to bootstrap initial growth of the network and attract providers.
LAVA tokens will be automatically distributed monthly to providers on-chain, and the amount of tokens will be variable depending on paid demand for data through Lava.

## 🌐 Community Pool
Lava has a community pool which accrues funds from block rewards, subscriptions and Incentivized RPC Pools. Funds can be used by the DAO to conduct future initiatives engaging the community. 
- **2%** of block rewards 
- **0.1%** of Subscription rewards
- **0.1%** of Incentivized RPC Pool rewards
