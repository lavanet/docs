## Overview 🔍

Web3 is only as strong as its weakest link. Today, due to complexities and lack of incentives to run your own node, apps rely on costly centralized services, unreliable public RPC endpoints, and self-hosted services. Lava is here to fix it. Access Lava, Access Web3.

Lava is built as an application-specific L1 PoS Blockchain, based on [CosmosSDK](https://tendermint.com/sdk/). We are building the most reliable, modular, and extensible network, which ensures high network performance and secure blockchain access for all web3 APIs. 

Lava documentation is intended to be the definitive reference for all technical aspects of Lava Protocol. For other information about Lava Network, please visit our [blog](https://www.lavanet.xyz/blog?utm_source=intro-page&utm_medium=docs) or review our new [research](https://community.lavanet.xyz/c/research/9?utm_source=intro-page&utm_medium=docs)!

## What is Lava? 🌋

**Lava is decentralizing access to blockchain data. It is the first truly unstoppable protocol for blockchain API access.**

Serving as a two-sided marketplace that incentivizes and coordinates blockchain nodes to provide dapps with blockchain data, Lava is setting the standard for fast, reliable, and secure APIs at scale.

### How Does It Work? 🔩

Lava’s network is a Web3 APIs marketplace that acts as a settlement layer with dynamic pricing. On one side are developers & dapps (consumers) who need access to data or want to send transactions, and on the other are node runners (providers) that earn rewards for servicing requests.

### Why Lava? ❣️

 Lava provides Multi-Chain RPC that just works:

1. **Quality of Service -** Consumers monitor and rate providers based on response time, availability and freshness. When asking for rewards, providers are required to attach their QoS score and are rewarded accordingly.

2. **Data Reliability -** Providers are subject to fraud and fault detection checks, whereby the network uses statistical inference and verifiably random selections to compare the responses of multiple providers. If a conflict is detected, the network uses an honest majority of providers to attain who was wrong, penalizing the offender.

3. **Privacy & Anonymity -** Relays are randomly distributed between a changing list of providers, so consumers are less likely to get service from the same provider for a significant period of time. Consumer-provider communications happen directly and identities are not linked to Lava Wallets.

4. **Scalability -** Every aspect of Lava is being built with scalability in mind. A single-step reward system, aggregation, direct provider-dapp communication and staking incentives are designed to increase efficiency by sparing unnecessary stress from the network.

5. **Decentralized Access -** We encourage users to access our network in a fully decentralized way.
More on that soon 👀

6. **Open Source -** Lava as a public good. A base for developers to build on and draw inspiration from.
