# Using LavaSDK 

## 🛡️ The Frontend 

☠️ **The Problem**:   Using private keys on the frontend without special provisions is inherently unsafe. In ordinary development scenarios, private keys from a user can be leaked through the browser. 

✅ **The Solution**:  Lava uses a unique solution called `badges` to solve these limitations. A `badge` consists of several parts and is used in lieu of a private key. It must, however, be signed by an external server that holds the relevant authorizing party's private key. The [default Badge Server](/badge-server#lava-badge-server-) is hosted by Lava and requires no additional configurations.

🚀 **Get Started**:  You can get started right from the [Lava Gateway](https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/?utm_source=sdk-frontend-page&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=docs-to-gateway)! We recognize that a hosted solution is not ideal for every use case. Users who are interested in accomplishing the highest levels of decentralization may run their own [badge server](/badge-server#running-a-badge-server-experimental-).

## ↪️ Recommended Flow

Although you can host your own badge server, the easiest way to get started is through Lava's Gateway. 
1. Sign up to the Gateway. 👉🏿[Register now](https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/?utm_source=sdk-frontend-page&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=docs-to-gateway) if you haven’t already!

2. Create a Project and Select your APIs!

3. Open an API and click LavaSDK.

3. Install the SDK into your project -> `npm install @lavanet-lava-sdk`

4. Copy & paste your code snippet into your code.


## 📛 Badges

### Usage ⚙️

Badges are objects passed to the SDK instance which allow a user to forgo the usage of private keys.  A badge has the following format:

```jsx
const myBadge = {
  badgeServerAddress: "https://badges.lavanet.xyz", // Or your own Badge-Server URL
  projectId: "<from gateway>" //input your project ID from the Gateway or custom setup
};
```

A user can initialize the SDK using a badge instead of a privatekey

```jsx
const lavaSDK = await LavaSDK.create({
    badge: myBadge,
    chainID: "LAV1",
    rpcInterface:  "rest",
});
```

And make calls all the same - no privatekeys exposed!

```jsx
const info = await lavaSDK.sendRelay({
    method: "GET",
    url: "/node_info",
});
```

🚀 That's it. For most users, there is no additional information required to successfully use LavaSDK on the front end!
