# Power-up the Lava Network
Lava Network, an L1 PoS blockchain, is powered by its participants. 

Participants joining the network help reinforce data reliability and high quality of service. Lava's incentive framework prioritizes API providers that excel and allows anyone to stake (same as other PoS chains). Lava achieves fair rewards, privacy and censorship resistance for users by distributing consensus.

Everything is on-chain, transparent.
