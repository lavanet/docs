# Running an NEAR RPC Node

## Requirements ðŸ“„ 

Before you start, ensure that your machine meets the following [minimum requirements](https://near-nodes.io/rpc/hardware-rpc):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="rec_req" label="Recommended">

    CPU: 8-Core (16-Thread) Intel i7/Xeon or equivalent with AVX support
    RAM: 20GB DDR4
    Storage: 1TB SSD  - NVMe SSD recommended
    OS: MacOS / Linux

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="min_req" label="Minimum">

```
CPU: 8-Core (16-Thread) Intel i7/Xeon or equivalent with AVX support
RAM: 12GB DDR4
Storage: 500GB SSD
OS: MacOS / Linux
```

</TabItem>

:::tip

Installing NEAR will also require a current installation of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), as well as many common dev tools (`python`, `docker`, `awscli`, & `protobuf-compiler`).

:::

## Install ðŸ“¥

Clone the NEARate-Community Repo and then run the Node Setup Script.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/near/nearcore
cd nearcore
git fetch origin --tags
```

Get the latest release

git checkout tags/1.25.0 -b mynode

make release

:::caution
Compilation is a time-intensive process and can take ~30 minutes or longer on recommmended hardware.
:::


```
./target/release/neard --home ~/.near init --chain-id mainnet --download-genesis --download-config
```

his command will create the required directory structure by generating a config.json, node_key.json, and downloads a genesis.json for mainnet.

### Start your Node! ðŸš€

Run the following command to initiate your node!

```bash
# Get data backup 
aws s3 --no-sign-request cp s3://near-protocol-public/backups/mainnet/rpc/latest .
LATEST=$(cat latest)
aws s3 --no-sign-request cp --no-sign-request --recursive s3://near-protocol-public/backups/mainnet/rpc/$LATEST ~/.near/data

# Start the Node!
./target/release/neard --home ~/.near run
```

## Apply to our Provider Incubation Program ðŸ“‹

In our current state of Testnet, there is an additional stage to pass through before you can become a provider on the Lava Network. Please fill out the [application form](https://lavanet.typeform.com/to/ORi3A13v?utm_source=becoming-a-lava-provider-for-NEAR&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=NEAR-post-grant) for our Provider Incubation Program. Feel free to drop a line in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UxujNZbW) once youâ€™ve completed this step!

## Setup your Provider on Lava Network ðŸŒ‹

Once youâ€™ve been accepted - to set up your provider on the Lava Network, you can refer to the [provider setup documentation](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/provider-setup?utm_source=running-a-NEAR-rpc-node&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=NEAR-post-grant) available elsewhere in our docs. This should provide you with the necessary information to configure and operate your provider node on the Lava Network.
