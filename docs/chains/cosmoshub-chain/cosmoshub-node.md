## Install `gaiad` 

One of the prerequisites to running a node on CosmosHub is the use of `gaiad`. To get started ensure that you [install `gaiad`](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/getting-started/installation.html).

## Configure and Start your Node! ðŸš€

Follow along with the official Cosmos guide on how to get your node started:
https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/join-mainnet.html#general-configuration

You will make changes to both `~/.gaia/config/config.toml` and `~/.gaia/config/app.toml` before running `gaiad start` !

## Apply to our Provider Incubation Program ðŸ“‹

In our current state of Testnet, there is an additional stage to pass through before you can become a provider on the Lava Network. Please fill out the [application form](https://lavanet.typeform.com/to/ORi3A13v?utm_source=becoming-a-lava-provider-for-cosmoshub&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cosmoshub-pre-grant) for our Provider Incubation Program. Feel free to drop a line in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UxujNZbW) once youâ€™ve completed this step!

## Setup your Provider on Lava Network ðŸŒ‹

Once youâ€™ve been accepted - to set up your provider on the Lava Network, you can refer to the [provider setup documentation](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/provider-setup?utm_source=running-a-cosmoshub-rpc-node&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cosmoshub-pre-grant) available elsewhere in our docs. This should provide you with the necessary information to configure and operate your provider node.
