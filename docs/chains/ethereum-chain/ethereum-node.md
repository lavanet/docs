## Choose your Path 🛣️

The current Ethereum recommended practice is to manage your node using DAppNode. You can follow along the very helpful guide provided by DAppNode [here](https://docs.dappnode.io/docs/user/getting-started/choose-your-path).

If you elect to go the more advanced route, you can setup your node using the command line or another recommended tool. A list of guided setups is available on the [Ethereum developer docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/#spinning-up-node).

⚠️ Starting an Ethereum node can involve a wide variety of commands depending upon your chosen path! 


## Apply to our Provider Incubation Program 📋

In our current state of Testnet, there is an additional stage to pass through before you can become a provider on the Lava Network. Please fill out the [application form](https://lavanet.typeform.com/to/ORi3A13v?utm_source=becoming-a-lava-provider-for-ethereum&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=ethereum-pre-grant) for our Provider Incubation Program. Feel free to drop a line in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UxujNZbW) once you’ve completed this step!

## Setup your Provider on Lava Network 🌋

Once you’ve been accepted - to set up your provider on the Lava Network, you can refer to the [provider setup documentation](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/provider-setup?utm_source=running-a-ethereum-rpc-node&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=ethereum-pre-grant) available elsewhere in our docs. This should provide you with the necessary information to configure and operate your provider node.
