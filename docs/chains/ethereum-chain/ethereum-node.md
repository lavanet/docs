# Running an Ethereum RPC Node

## Requirements üìÑ 

Ethereum nodes have some basic hardware requirements that must be met in order to proceed with the install process:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="manual_req" label="Manual">

```
Intel NUC, 7th gen or higher (x86) CPU

```

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="dappnode_req" label="DAppNode">

```
Intel Core i5/i7
32 GB RAM
4 TB NVMe storage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Choose your Path üõ£Ô∏è

Current Ethereum recommended practice is to manage your node using DAppNode. You can follow along the very helpful guide provided by DAppNode [here](https://docs.dappnode.io/docs/user/getting-started/choose-your-path).

If you elect to go the more advanced route, you can setup your node using the command line or another recommended tool. A list of guided setups is available on the [Ethereum developer docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/#spinning-up-node).

‚ö†Ô∏è Starting an Ethereum node can involve a wide variety of commands depending upon your chosen path! 


## Apply to our Provider Incubation Program üìã

In our current state of Testnet, there is an additional stage to pass through before you can become a provider on the Lava Network. Please fill out the [application form](https://lavanet.typeform.com/to/ORi3A13v?utm_source=becoming-a-lava-provider-for-ethereum&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=ethereum-pre-grant) for our Provider Incubation Program. Feel free to drop a line in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UxujNZbW) once you‚Äôve completed this step!

## Setup your Provider on Lava Network üåã

Once you‚Äôve been accepted - to set up your provider on the Lava Network, you can refer to the [provider setup documentation](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/provider-setup?utm_source=running-a-ethereum-rpc-node&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=ethereum-pre-grant) available elsewhere in our docs. This should provide you with the necessary information to configure and operate your provider node.
