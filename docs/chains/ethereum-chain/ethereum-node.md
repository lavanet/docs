# Running an Ethereum RPC Node

## Requirements ðŸ“„ 



## Apply to our Provider Incubation Program ðŸ“‹

In our current state of Testnet, there is an additional stage to pass through before you can become a provider on the Lava Network. Please fill out the [application form](https://lavanet.typeform.com/to/ORi3A13v?utm_source=becoming-a-lava-provider-for-ethereum&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=ethereum-pre-grant) for our Provider Incubation Program. Feel free to drop a line in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UxujNZbW) once youâ€™ve completed this step!

## Setup your Provider on Lava Network ðŸŒ‹

Once youâ€™ve been accepted - to set up your provider on the Lava Network, you can refer to the [provider setup documentation](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/provider-setup?utm_source=running-a-ethereum-rpc-node&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=ethereum-pre-grant) available elsewhere in our docs. This should provide you with the necessary information to configure and operate your provider node.
