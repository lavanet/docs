# Running a Lava RPC Node

## Requirements 📄 

The current recommended [hardware prerequisites](/hardware-requirements) for running a Lava RPC node are the following: 

```
16 GB RAM
512 GB SSD
x64 2.0 GHz 4v CPU 
```

## Install Lava 🌋

Using the [installation guide](/install-lava) , install all binaries, especially `lavad`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lavanet/lava.git
cd lava
make install-all
```

## Launch Your Node 🚀

Set up and configure your node according to the [guides](/join-testnet-manual) available.
You may use `Cosmovisor` (Recommended) or setup the node manually.

## Apply to our Provider Incubation Program 📋

In our current state of Testnet, there is an additional stage to pass through before you can become a provider on the Lava Network. Please fill out the [application form](https://lavanet.typeform.com/to/ORi3A13v?utm_source=becoming-a-lava-provider-for-lava&utm_medium=docs) for our Provider Incubation Program. Feel free to drop a line in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UxujNZbW) once you’ve completed this step!

## Setup your Provider on Lava Network 🌋

Once you’ve been accepted - to set up your provider on the Lava Network, you can refer to the [provider setup documentation](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/provider-setup?utm_source=running-a-lava-rpc-node&utm_medium=docs) available elsewhere in our docs. This should provide you with the necessary information to configure and operate your provider node.
