# Running an Evmos RPC Node

## Requirements üìÑ 

```
- 8 core CPU 
- 64gb of RAM
- go 1.20+
- jq 1.6+
- ports 8545/8546 open & exposed
```

## Install Evmos CLI üöÄ

This software is necessary to run an Evmos RPC node.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/evmos/evmos.git
cd evmos
git fetch
git checkout <tag>
make install
```

It is necessary to replace `<tag>` with the name of the latest release which is visible [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/tags).


## Start your Node ‚ùó

Starting a node with Evmos may require various configurations, but the commands are relatively simple:

```bash
./evmosd start \ 
    --json-rpc.enable \
    --api.enable \
    --grpc-web.enable \
    --grpc.enable
```
You can edit your `app.toml` file to change settings on your node. Within `app.toml` you can find gas cap, CORS, Pruning, and how to configure a WebSocket Server. For further information, consult the [Evmos documentation](https://docs.evmos.org/protocol/evmos-cli/configuration#running-the-json-rpc-server)
