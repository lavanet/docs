❓ Looking for a chain other than the ones listed here?
Make a [**blockchain integration request**](https://lavanet.upvoty.com/b/blockchain-integration-request/)!

🔗 You can get RPC endpoints for these chains on our [*Gateway*](https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/?utm_source=chains-page&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=docs-to-gateway) and we host [*Public Endpoints*](/public-rpc#incentivized-public-rpc-) for some chains here.

:::caution Work in Progress

Our `testnet` documentation is a work-in-progress. The following chains are LIVE (🔥) on Lava, but not yet documented: **Aptos**, **Arbitrum**, **Berachain**, **Canto**, **Fantom**, **Osmosis**, and **Polygon**.
