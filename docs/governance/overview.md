# 🗳️ Governance Overview

### Overview

Governance is at the heart of the Lava Network’s decentralized approach, enabling the community to shape the future of the protocol collaboratively.

The governance model in Lava is **on-chain**, meaning that all voting and proposal mechanisms are conducted directly on the blockchain. This ensures a transparent and tamper-proof process, where every stakeholder’s input can be tracked and verified. With this approach, the community collectively decides on upgrades, changes to network parameters, specification updates, and more.

### How Governance Works in Lava

The governance process typically follows a structured **proposal lifecycle**, where any community member can draft a proposal and submit it for review. Here’s a high-level overview:

1. **Proposal Drafting**: A community member identifies an area of improvement or a change needed and drafts a proposal outlining the details.
2. **Optional: Proposal Discussion**: A community member shares their proposal as a forum post for feedback, prior to onchain vote. 
3. **Deposit Period**: The proposal requires a minimum deposit of LAVA tokens to progress to vote. The deposit acts as a signal of intent and helps prevent spam proposals. 
4. **Voting Period**: Token holders can cast their votes on the proposal using options like **Yes**, **No**, **No with Veto**, or **Abstain**. The voting process is open to all LAVA stakers, including delegators.
5. **Tallying and Execution**: Once the voting period ends, the results are tallied based on specific thresholds (e.g., quorum, veto threshold). If the proposal passes, the changes are implemented on-chain.

### How to Participate in Governance

- **Discuss Proposals**: To discuss major proposals prior to the onchain voting process, go to the [Lava Community Forum](https://community.lavanet.xyz). Here, you can browse key discussion points which may become onchain votes e.g. update to the protocol that changes Provider requirements. 
- **Review Proposals**: To view and follow ongoing proposals, visit the [Lava Governance Explorer on Explorer Guru](https://lava.explorers.guru/proposals). Here, you can read the proposal details and track its current status.
- **Vote on Proposals**: If you’re a LAVA token holder, you can cast your vote directly on the [Lava Voting Dashboard on Mellifera Network](https://lava-explorer.mellifera.network/lava/gov). This platform allows you to participate in governance decisions and make your voice heard.

These explorer links provide a user-friendly way for the community to engage with live governance proposals, ensuring transparency and ease of participation.
