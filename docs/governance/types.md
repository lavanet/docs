# üìë Types of Proposals

In Lava Network, proposals are the primary mechanism for implementing changes, upgrades, and improvements. The community can submit different types of proposals depending on the nature of the change they want to make. These proposals are categorized into several types, each with its specific use case.

---

### 1. Text Proposals 

**Purpose**: Text proposals are non-binding and are primarily used for signaling or gathering feedback from the community. They do not directly result in changes to the protocol but can influence future decisions or provide clarity on community preferences.

**Examples**:

- Proposals to gather opinions on future feature additions.
- Signaling support for new community initiatives or projects.

**üó≥Ô∏è Voting Outcome**: While the vote outcome does not directly trigger changes, a majority "Yes" vote can provide strong community endorsement for the suggested action.

### 2. Parameter Change Proposals 

**Purpose**: Parameter change proposals are used to modify the configuration of the Lava Network without requiring a software upgrade. These proposals enable the community to adjust various protocol parameters to optimize performance, security, and incentives.

**Examples**:

- Adjusting the inflation rate of LAVA tokens.
- Modifying the slashing parameters for validators.
- Changing the unbonding period for staked tokens.

**üó≥Ô∏è Voting Outcome**: If passed, the new parameters are automatically applied to the network, and the changes take effect without interrupting the blockchain‚Äôs operation.

### 3. Software Upgrade Proposals 

**Purpose**: Software upgrade proposals are used to introduce new features, patches, or improvements that require changes to the Lava blockchain‚Äôs underlying software. These proposals are critical for implementing significant upgrades and fixing bugs.

**Examples**:

- Upgrading the Lava blockchain to a new version of the Cosmos SDK.
- Implementing new modules or features within the Lava protocol.
- Patching vulnerabilities discovered in the network code.

**üó≥Ô∏è Voting Outcome**: If the proposal is approved, validators are required to download and install the new software version. The upgrade process is coordinated, and once the majority of validators are ready, the network transitions seamlessly to the new version.

### 4. Specification Proposals 

**Purpose**: Specification proposals are unique to the Lava Network. They are used to add, update, or modify API specifications (specs) for different blockchains and services supported by Lava. These proposals ensure that the Lava protocol can adapt to new chains and evolving API requirements.

**Examples**:

- Adding support for a new blockchain (e.g., integrating Optimism mainnet specs).
- Updating existing specs for a chain to include new API methods.
- Modifying compute units (CU) assigned to specific API calls based on resource requirements.

**üó≥Ô∏è Voting Outcome**: Once a specification proposal is approved, it becomes part of the Lava Network‚Äôs official API registry. Providers must update their services to comply with the new specs to continue serving requests and earning rewards.

### 5. Community Pool Spend Proposals 

**Purpose**: Community pool spend proposals are designed to allocate funds from the community pool to support projects, initiatives, or contributions that benefit the Lava ecosystem.

**Examples**:

- Funding a developer grant to build new tooling for Lava.
- Allocating resources for marketing campaigns or community events.
- Providing support for ecosystem research and development projects.

**üó≥Ô∏è Voting Outcome**: If passed, the requested funds are disbursed from the community pool to the specified recipient. This process is managed on-chain to ensure transparency and accountability.
