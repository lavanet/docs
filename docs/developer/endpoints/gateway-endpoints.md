# Lava Gateway

## Easy-to-use access to free RPC across 15+ networks

The Lava Gateway, developed and managed by the Magma Devs team, is a simple web interface that gives developers free and instant RPC endpoints for leading blockchains. 


Gateway registrants can select plug-and-play mainnet and testnet endpoints for:

- Arbitrum
- Axelar
- Base
- BSC
- Cosmos Hub
- Ethereum
- Filecoin
- Hyperliquid
- Lava
- Near
- Optimism
- Polygon
- Starknet
- Solana
- ...and more




### Step 1: Create your Gateway account

To access endpoints through the Gateway, first create an account using the following link: 

**URL:** [`https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/`](https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/)


<br/>

### Step 2: Select the chain that you’re building on

Once registered, you will see the following UI, which displays the chains currently supported on the Gateway:

Simply select the chain you’re building on and you will be presented with the endpoint options for the selected chain:

### Step 3: Select your mainnet or testnet endpoint

Lava provides mainnet and testnet endpoints for each chain.

Use the toggle to select the appropriate endpoint for your needs. 

Your dedicated chain endpoint and corresponding code snippet will be provided below:

:::note
RPC endpoints are provided through HTTP as standard. 
Certain chains - such as the Ethereum example below - have additional RPC interfaces including WEBSOCKET.
