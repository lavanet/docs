# Lava RPC

RPC is essential for interacting with blockchains — every interaction, such as trading, swapping, staking, and even checking the wallet balance, is an RPC request. Lava provides data consumers (AI agents, dApps, indexers, explorers, wallets, etc.) with an easy way to access fast and ultra-reliable RPC.

## Consumer Preferences and Configurations
Data providers across various chains compete to deliver the highest-performing service. Consumers are directed to the most suitable providers based on service quality and their specific priorities. Depending on consumer requirements, configurations can be set to prioritize certain provider attributes, such as response latency, accuracy, availability, or broader strategies like distributing requests across multiple providers for enhanced privacy.

## Rate Limits
Lava provides developers with open endpoints that leverage its infrastructure to dynamically route requests between different providers. These endpoints are open, free, and allow data access at a rate of 3 requests per second.

Data consumers can increase their usage limits and access different APIs by purchasing subscriptions using Lava’s native tokens.

## Subscriptions
In Lava, subscriptions act as passes that consumers purchase to access various APIs. They enable users to reward providers and manage access.

Projects, on the other hand, serve as spaces within subscriptions where developers can organize and manage resources. They help developers efficiently allocate computing power. Together, subscriptions and projects give users control and provide a flexible system for developers to work effectively within the Lava ecosystem.

Currently, subscriptions are in Beta. If you would like to purchase a subscription on the Lava mainnet, reach out to the Lava team.
