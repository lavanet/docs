## Deployment options
- VPS instance (on any cloud provider) - recommended ⭐️
- Shared compute instance (e.g. AWS EC2 instance)
- Your personal station - less recommended

**Docker** container are available at [Lava's repository on GitHub](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/tree/main/docker)

## Hardware requirements

As the network grows, bandwidth, CPU, and memory requirements rise. Large hard drives are recommended for storing years of blockchain history, as well as significant RAM to process the increasing amount of transactions.

Also, running on testnet and mainnet will feature different requirements.

**Recommended for Testnet**

| Node Type     | RAM                   | Storage       | CPU
| -----------   | --------------------- | -----------   | ---
| Full          | 8GB                   | 100GB SSD          | x64 2.0 GHz 4v CPU

Settings:

- Minimum `Instance Type` - **`c4.xlarge`**
- `Configure storage` - **`GP2 drive`**

</details>

### Operating system
- For using the prebuilt `lavad` - you need to run **`Ubuntu` - `20`** or newer.
- sudo permissions on your machine (e.g. can run `sudo hostname`)
