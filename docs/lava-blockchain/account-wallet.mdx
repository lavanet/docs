Lava uses Cosmos bank & account modules and enables you to use any standard Cosmos wallet.

### Prepare an account using the CLI {#account}
First need to add a wallet to your keyring ([FAQ: what is a keyring](faq#keyring)).

While you may use your seed phrase to import an existing wallet, we'll make a new one in this scenario.
replace $ACCOUNT_NAME with a name of your choosing:

```bash
current_lavad_binary="$HOME/.lava/cosmovisor/current/bin/lavad"
ACCOUNT_NAME="name_here"
$current_lavad_binary keys add $ACCOUNT_NAME
```

:::danger
Ensure you write down the mnemonic as you can not recover the wallet without it. 
:::

To ensure your wallet was saved to your keyring, look for the `KEY_NAME` is in your keys list:

```bash
$current_lavad_binary keys list
```

The last thing needed before initializing the validator is to obtain your **validator public** key which was created when you first initialized your node. To obtain your validator pubkey:

```bash
$current_lavad_binary tendermint show-validator
```

:::caution Pencils out 📝
Keep the newly created account info:
1. SECRET mnemonic phrase 🚨🤫🚨🤫🚨
2. Your public address, starts with `lava@`
3. Your validator pubkey

♻ Save those details as we make sure to automatically airdrop you with LAVA test tokens as soon as we restart the testnet.
