# Add Lava to your chain 
Incentivized Public RPC Pools (ipRPC) allow sponsors—such as DAOs, foundations, or blockchain ecosystem teams—to fund public RPC access for their users, while ensuring high-quality service from Lava’s decentralized provider network.

By creating an ipRPC pool, sponsors can:

✅ Guarantee reliable, fast RPC access for end users without requiring them to stake or pay individually

✅ Onboard developers and apps faster by removing the friction of setting up RPC infrastructure

✅ Maintain quality of service by directly incentivizing providers to serve your chain

✅ Use any IBC-compatible token (plus a minimal amount of LAVA) to fund the pool and shape reward emissions

✅ Customize rewards with flexible emission schedules and distribution parameters

✅ Preserve token value by setting a minimum-cost floor, ensuring providers are compensated meaningfully

ipRPC pools work through a Server Kit / gateway interface, allowing authenticated consumers to act on behalf of users. These consumers have special subscriptions tied to your funded pool, and every time users interact with your chain, providers earn rewards from your pool in addition to their regular Lava earnings.


## Why add Lava to your chain
Lava eliminates the need for bootstrapping and managing public RPC endpoints. By leveraging Lava, blockchain networks can deploy incentive pools to attract a community of top-tier node runners, ensuring a high-quality, decentralized infrastructure.

- Blockchains and rollups can bootstrap infrastructure seamlessly, with service quality enforced by the Lava protocol.

- Node providers are rated and rewarded based on response time, availability, and data freshness.

- Chains can create incentive pools using any token to reward node operators for running RPC infrastructure.

- ipRPC endpoints are given unified URLs serviced by diverse providers of each chain's ecosystem. This helps to improve dApp reliability and reduce endpoint fragmentation.

## How does the process of adding Lava to your chain looks like

1. **Creating an Incentive Pool**

    Blockchain developers can establish an incentive pool using any token, including:
        - Native blockchain tokens
        - Stablecoins
        - Memecoins

   Incentive pools reward node operators for contributing infrastructure to the Lava ecosystem. If you would like to create an Incentive Pool for your chain, reach out to the Lava team.

2. **Adding a specification for the chain**

    Chains define the infrastructure services as specifications (”specs”). Those sepcifications can be created either by Lava team or by ecosystem contributors (champions), in coordnation with the team of the chain for clear configuration and optimal setup.

3. **Attracting RPC Node Runners**

    Lava enables small and medium-sized node runners to provide RPC services for chains and earn rewards from the incentive pool. This broadens participation beyond major node providers, which typically support only a limited number of chains.

4. **Enhancing Decentralized Infrastructure**

    By utilizing Lava, developers can:
    - Reduce fragmentation of RPC endpoints.
    - Improve reliability and uptime of their ecosystem’s infrastructure.
    - Scale RPC and API provisioning seamlessly.
