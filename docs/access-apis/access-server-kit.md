# Lava Access Server kit

ðŸŒ‹ **Backends devs? Enterprises? Self-hosted and secure gateway access to Web3 APIs, the Lava way ðŸ˜‰**

The Lava Access Server kit is a GO language reference implementation that provides self-hosted gateway access to blockchain APIs, designed as a solution for running as a backend server.

:::note 
The Lava Access Server Kit is currently in an experimental phase and its code is available on our [Github repository](https://github.com/lavanet/lava). 

We are on the "move fast and break things" phase of development, so while we have made the code accessible to the public, we do not offer official support at this time. Keep in mind that there may be major changes during this phase.

_If you just need API Access - checkout our [SDK](/access-apis/access-sdk.md) or [Gateway](/access-apis/gateway-access.md)_
