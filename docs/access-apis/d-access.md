Like DeFi brought the "D" to CeFi, Lava is bringing the "D" to Access.

As a developer building applications on blockchains, you are a Consumer on the Lava Network. Lava offers an SDK that enables you to easily interact with the Lava Network and make trustless RPC calls to Relay Chains. Our SDK provides you with a range of benefits, including increased privacy, faster transaction speed, improved data reliability, censorship-resistance, and enhanced node availability. Use our SDK to easily build applications that take advantage of all that the Lava Network has to offer.
