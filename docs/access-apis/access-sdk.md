# Lava SDK

:::caution COMING SOON! ‚è∞
open-source expected during Q2 2023
:::

üåã **Programmatic, decentralized access to any Web3 API, from anywhere, the Lava way üòâ**

The **Lava SDK** is a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK reference implementation designed for developers looking for access through the Lava Network.
It can be added to your app/dapp and run in browsers to provide multi-chain peer-to-peer access to blockchain APIs. Whereas the Gateway provides a preconfigured user experience and project-based functionality, the SDK allows for you to set the parameters of access according to the needs of your application. With only a few lines of code, a developer can interact with a variety of blockchains across different interfaces.

### Features

1. Access any supported chain RPC APIs
2. Runs from browser
3. Etherjs/Cosmjs integrations (coming soon!)
