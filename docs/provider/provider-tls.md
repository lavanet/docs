# Provider TLS Setup Guide

 All providers must use a domain name and TLS. Make sure to acquire one using a domain registrar of your choice before following this guide.

## Prerequisites

| Required Setup            |  ?  | 
| --------------------------|-----|
| A domain name            | ✅  |
| `lavap` is [installed & configured](../intro/install-lava.md#install-a-specific-binary-) | ✅  |
| [Account](../intro/wallet.mdx#cli) with `ulava` balance      | ✅  |


## Step 1: Change the A Record on your Domain


The first step of establishing your Provider is to modify some of the DNS settings on the domain you purchased. In specific, you'll need to change the A Records on your domain. Changing your `A-Record` will create a subdomain that routes traffic to a specific provider process. Depending upon who you've purchased your domain through, A-Records may be visible under `Advanced DNS` or another label.

<details>
<summary> Multiple Records (Recommended) </summary>


We recommend you create a separate `A-Record` for each one of the chains that you plan to support. This is more secure, as the default behavior is to refuse connection unless a consumer connects on the correct subdomain. 

For each chain you want to support, add an `A-Record` with the desired chain name as the `Host`, the `Value` will be your server IP.
For example, if you wanted to support Ethereum & Lava Mainnets, Your DNS Settings should include the following :

| Record Type       |  Host | Value |
| ------------------|-------| ----- |
| A-Record          |   eth |   Your-Server-Public-IP-Address-Here   |
| A-Record          |  lava |   Your-Server-Public-IP-Address-Here   |
</details>

<details>
<summary> Single Record </summary>

Alternatively, you can create one `A-Record` that captures traffic to all sub-domains. If you are supporting a large number of chains that frequently changes, doing this may somewhat simplify your process.

| Record Type       | Host | Value |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| A-Record          | *    | Your-Server-Public-IP-Address-Here |
</details>
<br />

## Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

We will guide you on setting up and configuring Nginx to use a TLS certificate and handle connections to different provider processes. It is also possible to use alternative solutions for these two tasks, such as Caddy, Envoy or your preferred solution.

Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot net-tools nginx python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

<br />

## Step 3: Generate Certificate 

Next, we need to actually create the `TLS certificate` via the certifying authority. This process is automated by `certbot`.


Use `certbot` to create a certificate:

```
sudo certbot certonly -d you.xyz -d lava.you.xyz -d eth.you.xyz
```

Note, you will need one `-d` flag for each subdomain you created as an `A-Record`. Even if you opted to create a Single Record, you still need to indicate a subdomain for each provider process you will run. We use the filler `you.xyz` as an example above.

You may be met with several prompts. Use `nginx` or Nginx Web Server Plugin when asked. 
<br />

## Step 4: Validate Certificate

Let's make sure your certificate successfully installed! ✅ Input the following command:

```sudo certbot certificates```

Keep track of your output. If your certificate generation was successful, it should look as following:

```
Found the following certs:
  Certificate Name: your-site.com
    Domains: your-site.com eth.your-site.com lava.your-site.com
    Expiry Date: 2023-11-07 14:37:29+00:00 (VALID: 84 days)
    Certificate Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/fullchain.pem
    Private Key Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/privkey.pem

```

You'll need both `Certificate Path` and `Private Key Path` for your next step.

<br />

## Step 5: Add an Nginx Config for Each Domain

Lava recommends running each chain under a separate provider process. This will separate error logs and protect against complete provider failure in the case of a problematic provider process. The first step of this is to create different nginx routes for each chain.

For each chain that you want to support, you will need to create a separate `nginx` config file. Create a `server` file for each chain. Example below shows how to create a `server` file for Ethereum and Lava chains:

1. Navigate to the nginx configuration directory:

```bash
`cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
```

2. Create a `server` files:

```bash
touch eth_server
touch lava_server
```

3. Configure nginx. You will need to select an open port for each chain. `Nginx` will use these config files to create your routes.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="eth_ex" label="eth nginx server">

Open the server file:
```bash
sudo nano eth_server
``` 

Set the configuration:
```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name eth.your-site.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/privkey.pem;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/debug.log debug;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2223;
        grpc_pass 127.0.0.1:2223;
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lav_ex" label="lava nginx server">

Open the server file:
```bash
sudo nano lava_server
```

Add the configuration:
```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name lava.your-site.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-site.com/privkey.pem;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/debug.log debug;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2224;
        grpc_pass 127.0.0.1:2224;
    }
}
```


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Caddy" label="caddy example">

:::warning
The below caddy example is to provide guidance only. The recommended route is through `nginx`. Although making a provider functional with Caddy is possible you are proceeding at your own risk and with your own expertise.
:::


```
https://your-site.com:443 {
   reverse_proxy {
    to h2c://127.0.0.1:2221
    transport http  {
        versions h2c 2
    }
   }
   log {
       output file /var/log/caddy/your-site.com.log
   }
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

3. In most cases, after creating a configuration file in accessible sites, you need to create a symbolic link to this file in the enabled sites directory. This can be done with a command like:
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/lava_server /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/lava_server
```
:::caution

The above examples use ports `443` for external listening and `2223` / `2224` for internal comms, respectively. Using ports other than `443` for external listening means that some users will not be able to connect to your provider. This can result in less rewards and poorer quality of service. For internal listening, be aware that some ports on your OS may be used for internal communication and should be avoided.

## Step 6: Test Nginx Configuration

Now, ensure that your `nginx` setup is working! ✅

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

Expected Output:
```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

<br />

## Step 7: Restart Nginx

You will need to refresh the Nginx server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
<br />

## Step 8: Start RPC provider service
Now that you have Nginx configured you can move to the next step of starting the RPC provider service. Head to the [provider setup](./provider-setup.md) page for a detailed guide.
