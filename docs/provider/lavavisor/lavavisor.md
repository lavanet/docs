# **LavaVisor**


## ðŸ“„ Overview 
LavaVisor acts as a service manager for the Lava protocol application binaries. Its duty is to manage protocol versioning and coordinate seamless transitions to updated protocol versions.

When an upgrade becomes necessary, either because the current protocol version has dropped below the minimum version or not compliant with the recommended target version, LavaVisorâ€™s responsibilities begin. LavaVisor orchestrates the necessary upgrade process in an automated manner, ensuring that the protocol version is aligned with the current standards and capabilities set by the minimum and target versions.

## ðŸ§° Setup

:::tip
Some older versions of the `lava-protocol` binary (now `lavap`) lack the version command, which LavaVisor employs to validate binary versions. Please ensure you've updated to the most recent version of LavaVisor or you may face errors.
:::

Lavavisor is added as a `LAVA_ALL_BINARIES` parameter in the Makefile. As such, any script that executes `install-all` such as `start_env_dev.sh` will automatically install Lavavisor binary. 

To ensure that a LavaVisor binary is created, navigate to your local `/lava` directory and run  **`make install-all`**


### Prerequisites âœ…

1. Go version above than 1.19

### Whats next?
Proceed to either [Process Wrapper](/lavavisor-wrap) or [Service Manager](/lavavisor-services) to set up your lavavisor properly

### Which one should I choose? 

we recommend using the process wrapper as it has more capabilities such as running with keyring os and it has more control over the process.
The service manager is useful for many services under one machine as it will hold only one lavavisor instance that will use less queries, but it is less recommended to use as it cant work with keyring-backend os and it doesnt fit dockers / kubernetes services.
