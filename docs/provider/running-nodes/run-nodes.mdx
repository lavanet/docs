# Node Configuration

The first step in your RPC configuration setup is running a node for the chain you would like to support.
For example, if you would like to run NEAR RPC provider service, first you will have to configure and run NEAR mainnet or testnet node. 

Each chain has different server requrements and configuration steps. It is highly recommended to use the official documentation of supported chains 
to setup and configure nodes.

Once you have the nodes up and running, you can continue to the next steps.
