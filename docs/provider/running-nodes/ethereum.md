## Choose your Path üõ£Ô∏è

Current Ethereum recommended practice is to manage your node using DAppNode. You can follow along the very helpful guide provided by DAppNode [here](https://docs.dappnode.io/docs/user/getting-started/choose-your-path).

If you elect to go the more advanced route, you can setup your node using the command line or another recommended tool. A list of guided setups is available on the [Ethereum developer docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/#spinning-up-node).
