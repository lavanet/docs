## What is Lava? ðŸŒ‹
Lava is the first modular data access layer for blockchains. It introduces specs: a modular primitive that lets contributors permissionlessly add support for new chains and data services to the base protocol. RPC is the first service supported by the protocol but we are soon bringing further choice by integrating with indexing and API partners, such as Subsquid.

Data consumers send requests to Lavaâ€™s network of data providers (node operators), who join Lava to meet demand for data. Lava creates dynamic, scalable markets around any blockchain data service. The protocol also creates crypto-economic guarantees around the quality of service, across speed, uptime and data accuracy.

By leveraging modular architecture and a peer-to-peer network of node operators, Lava creates a unified platform for accessing the multi-chain world.


## Overview ðŸ”Ž

This repository (**@lavanet/docs**) contains technical documentation for the Lava ecosystem. The most recent version of this repository is deployed to the Lava docs [website](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/) and is viewable there. If you're averse to rich formatting, Lava Documentation can also be browsed as plain source in the markdown files available in the [docs folder](/docs/) of this repository. The Lava docs website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator, and deployed using the [Netlify Web Platform](https://www.netlify.com/).

Contents include:

- Information on Lava's supported chains
- Installation & Setup Guides for Validators, Providers, and Developers
- Network & Protocol Details on Lava's Unique Features
- Links to in-demand RPC & Web3 APIs

## Contribution ðŸ‘¥

Contributing to the documentation of Lava is a rewarding way to give back to the ecosystem. We always welcome contributors with love & kindness. After reviewing this README, please read the [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to help you get started.


## Deployment ðŸš€

### Status

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/58c0a448-7af0-48d3-8e29-86fc4a6f4868/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sage-swan-13ac7b/deploys)

### Process
The `main` branch of this repository is automatically deployed to our docs site, and other branches and pull requests leverage Netlify deploy. Please note that unless you are a recognized contributor of this repository, each attempted PR generates a Netlify approval that will prevent your pull request from being merged. Once the request is approved and a Netlify deploy preview is generated, a Netlify deploy preview will appear in the body of your PR as `ðŸ˜Ž Deploy Preview`. This deploy preview will be audited by a docs maintainer before merging your pull request.

## Local Development ðŸ”§

### 1. Fork this repository!

We recommend naming your fork `lava-docs` to distinguish from other projects which might have similar naming conventions.

### 2. Clone your fork

SSH **(recommended)**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Your-User-Name-Here/lava-docs.git
```

HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Your-User-Name-Here/lava-docs.git
```

### 3. Set up environmental variables

```bash
cd lava-docs/
cp .env.example .env
```

Change the contents of your environmental variables(`.env`) file to the following:

```
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=demo
ALGOLIA_API_KEY=demo
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=demo
```

Algolia search needs values assigned to these in order to start. For local docs instances (w/ non-functional search), any dummy values will work.

### 4. Install all packages

```
yarn install
```

### 5. Host a local preview of the docs (*Optional*)

```
yarn start
```

Your preview will dynamically change/hotload as you make changes to files.

### 6. Build a local deployment of the docs (*Optional*)

```
yarn build
```

Your build will appear in the `./build/` folder of your docs directory.

### 7. Deploy to Github (*Optional*)

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```
